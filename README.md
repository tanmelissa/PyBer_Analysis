# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
This is an exploratory analysis of PyBer's data including driver count, cities, types of cities, total riders, and fare prices. This analysis will include various charts to help PyBer to visualize and make sense of this data.
## Results

When comparing total weekly fare by city type from Jan to April 2019, we can see that the city types do not overlap in fare earned. Urban makes the most, suburban next, and rural makes the least.

Suburban cities seem to have the least variation in fare earned, with the highest fare on Feburary 24 and the lowest on January 1, but the rest remaining fairly consistent. Rural cities have more variation of fare earned week to week, with the highest fare on April 7 and the lowest on January 13; while urban cities increased in fare up until the end of February, with the highest fare on February 24 then decreased until the end of April with the lowest on January 6.

Each city type had their lowest total fares in January. It is possible that the end of year holidays affected people's needs or desires to use PyBer.

Rural cities have less rides than urban and suburban cities, but the average fare also tends to be higher.

Urban cites have the most drivers.

Urban cities also have the most rides.

## Summary

The higher fare price in rural cities may be keeping more people from using PyBer. This may be due to the longer distances that may be traveled in rural cities. People may not need to travel as far in urban or suburban cities, resulting in shorter rides and less fare. This would make using PyBer less convenient and more expensive for those in rural cities. One way to address this could be to decrease the fare price in rural cities to increase demand for our service. Another suggestion is to promote carpooling to help reduce fare per passenger but not reduce fare earned by PyBer.

Most PyBer drivers are in urban cities. The lack of drivers in suburban and rural cities could be making wait times for rides to be longer, thereby making using PyBer less convenient. Gathering more data on wait time and how that affects the users and their satisfaction with PyBer may give us valuable insight into whether increasing the amount of drivers in urban and rural cities will help to increase the total fare.

Doing further analysis on other aspects that could affect people's choice to use PyBer may give us better insight in where to put our resources. Looking at total population of urban, suburban, and rural cities, percentage of population that own their own car, and average ride distance could help us to see what other factors are affecting demand for ride sharing (possibly based on need of a vehicle, the length of the ride needed and thereby the price of the ride, how does ride-sharing compare to public transportation). This could give us insight into whether increasing drivers or decreasing fare rates would best increase our total fares.
