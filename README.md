# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
This is an exploratory analysis of PyBer's data including, driver count, cities, types of cities, total riders, and fare prices. This analysis will include various charts to help PyBer to visualize and make sense of this data.
## Results

When comparing total weekly fare by city type from Jan to April 2019, we can see that each city type do not overlap in fare earned. Urban makes the most, suburban next, and rural makes the least.

Suburban cities seem to have the least variation in fare earned, with a peak in the end of February and a valley in April, but the rest remaining fairly consistent. Rural cities have more variation of fare earned week to week, while urban cities increased in fare up until the end of February/early March, then decreased until the end of April (with some ups and downs on the way).
